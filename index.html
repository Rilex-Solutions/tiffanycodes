		<h2 class="title">A bit about myself</h2>
		<p>Hello! I very much enjoy living in Colorado. I love to knit anywhere and everywhere. If I am sitting, I am knitting... unless I'm coding! Thankfully, I have a codeCat to keep me company. Having a successfull career in special education and educational technology, I am beyond excited to make the change to full time program development. I love the change of solving complex problems, working in a team, and being creative. </p>

                            <p class="cards__description">The project is a single page presentation with several sections on the page. Each section has its own styling though there are repeated styling elements through out. This project is an assigned project. The project is structured using the BEM file structure and methodology. Technologies used are keyframe animations, embeded videos, images, compund selectors, mixins, importation of css files into main index.css file, rounded borders on photos, and other css styling.

                            <p class="cards__description"> The project was focused on improving the user experience through the lens of responsive coding. The design brief was delivered in Figma thus allowing us to work collabortatively in our Pair-Programming sessions. Using media queries, css grid, image compression, and flexbox to create a beautiful, pixel-perfect, site wheter the user is viewing on the standard computer monitor or the smallest of phone screens.

User is able to change the profile name, information, and profile image. Using REST API and backend server support, the user is also able to upload their own photo the site and like photos left by others! Media query again for responsive design. Also used the :hover and :active features on classes.

	“Tiffany is an exceptional software developer. Her ability to learn and retain information has during her studies at Practicum has prepared her to solve any problem that comes her way. Although Tiffany is a fast learner, she is very careful and cautious about her work. She has a knack for pixel-perfect UI design, and always gives 100% when it comes to completing tasks. She's been an absolute pleasure to work with and always brings the best out in the people she surrounds herself with. Tiffany would be an asset to have on any team. ”</p>

	“I've been fortunate to work with Tiffany as my pair programming partner for our sprints during the Practicum Web Developer curriculum. Our projects primarily consisted of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including React). It's been an absolute pleasure working with her as our pairing involved not just writing code, but problem solving as we bounced ideas off each other. She's super enthusiastic and brings strong positive energy to the team (definitely helpful during the tough times). With her love for tech and her endless creativity, I can't wait to see what else she will build, and hope to work with her again in the future!”</p>
