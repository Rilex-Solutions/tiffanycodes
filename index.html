	“Tiffany is an exceptional software developer. Her ability to learn and retain information has during her studies at Practicum has prepared her to solve any problem that comes her way. Although Tiffany is a fast learner, she is very careful and cautious about her work. She has a knack for pixel-perfect UI design, and always gives 100% when it comes to completing tasks. She's been an absolute pleasure to work with and always brings the best out in the people she surrounds herself with. Tiffany would be an asset to have on any team. ”</p>

	“I've been fortunate to work with Tiffany as my pair programming partner for our sprints during the Practicum Web Developer curriculum. Our projects primarily consisted of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including React). It's been an absolute pleasure working with her as our pairing involved not just writing code, but problem solving as we bounced ideas off each other. She's super enthusiastic and brings strong positive energy to the team (definitely helpful during the tough times). With her love for tech and her endless creativity, I can't wait to see what else she will build, and hope to work with her again in the future!”</p>
