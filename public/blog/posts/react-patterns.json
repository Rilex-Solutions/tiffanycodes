In this post, we'll explore modern patterns that help create maintainable, performant applications.\n\n## Component Architecture\n\nThe foundation of any scalable React app starts with good component architecture. Here are the key principles:\n\n### 1. Single Responsibility Principle\nEach component should have one clear purpose. If a component is doing too many things, it's time to break it down.\n\n### 2. Composition Over Inheritance\nReact favors composition patterns. Instead of creating complex inheritance hierarchies, compose smaller components together.\n\n```jsx\n// Good: Composition\nfunction UserProfile({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Avatar user={user} />\n      <UserDetails user={user} />\n      <UserActions user={user} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## State Management Strategies\n\nModern state management has evolved beyond Redux. Here's when to use different approaches:\n\n### Local State (useState, useReducer)\nPerfect for component-specific state that doesn't need to be shared.\n\n### Context API\nGreat for app-wide state that doesn't change frequently (theme, user auth).\n\n### External Libraries (Zustand, Jotai)\nIdeal for complex state that needs to be shared across many components.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nKey strategies for keeping your React app fast:\n\n### 1. Memoization\nUse React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically.\n\n### 2. Code Splitting\nImplement route-based and component-based code splitting.\n\n### 3. Virtual Scrolling\nFor large lists, implement virtualization.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nA scalable app needs a robust testing strategy:\n\n- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and hooks\n- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions\n- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user flows\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding scalable React applications is about making thoughtful architectural decisions early and maintaining them consistently. Focus on component composition, appropriate state management, and performance from the start.\n\nRemember: premature optimization is the root of all evil, but planning for scale is essential."
